# Getting Started

To get started is to visit [linuxgsm.com](http://linuxgsm.com/servers) and pick a server to install. Follow the simple step-by-step guide to install your game server on Linux.

Once the installation is complete a working game server will be available. Use the various LinuxGSM commands available to manage the game server.

Read through this documentation to ensure you understand how to configure your game server.

The [configuration](configuration/) section will help you understand how to configure both LinuxGSM and the game server.
