## To-DO

## Release Settings

Minecraft java edition splits up its release in two ways. Firstly a branch, this is either classed as a _release_ or a _snapshot._ A release is a stable version of the game whereas a snapshot is still under development

With LinuxGSM you can specify a specific release/snapshot or the latest release/snapshot. By default, LinuxGSM will use the latest release.
