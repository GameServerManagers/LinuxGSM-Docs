Most of these can be set in the server's `UTGame.ini`, so there's no need to clutter up the command line.

## **Server GameSpy Login**

All servers require a **unique** login to allow a server to show in the master server list. This login has to be created via the client "Create Profile". You can create multiple profiles under the same email address but you must use the same password for each if you do so.

## **Server Names**

Server names can be specified in the server's `UTGame.ini`

The `ServerDescription` field isn't in plain ascii or text as you and I know it. Instead its in UCS2 \(UTF-16\) which is then serialised as numeric strings.

## **Enable Mapvote**

Edit the `UTGame.ini`. Under the `[UTGame.UTGame]` section, be sure to have this:

```text
bAllowMapVoting=True
VoteDuration=45
GameSpecificMapCycles=(GameClassName="UTDeathmatch",Maps=("DM-Arsenal","DM-Biohazard","DM-CarbonFire","DM-Deck","DM-Defiance","DM-Deimos","DM-Diesel","DM-Fearless","DM-Gateway","DM-HeatRay","DM-RisingSun","DM-Sanctuary","DM-Sentinel","DM-ShangriLa"))
GameSpecificMapCycles=(GameClassName="UTTeamGame",Maps=("DM-Arsenal","DM-Biohazard","DM-CarbonFire","DM-Deck","DM-Defiance","DM-Deimos","DM-Diesel","DM-Fearless","DM-Gateway","DM-HeatRay","DM-RisingSun","DM-Sanctuary","DM-Sentinel","DM-ShangriLa"))
GameSpecificMapCycles=(GameClassName="UTCTFGame_Content",Maps=("CTF-Coret","CTF-Hydrosis","CTF-Reflection","CTF-Vertebrae","CTF-OmicronDawn","CTF-Strident"))
GameSpecificMapCycles=(GameClassName="UTVehicleCTFGame_Content",Maps=("VCTF-Containment","VCTF-Corruption","VCTF-Kargo","VCTF-Necropolis","VCTF-Sandstorm","VCTF-Suspense"))
GameSpecificMapCycles=(GameClassName="UTOnslaughtGame_Content",Maps=("WAR-Avalanche","WAR-Downtown","WAR-Dusk","WAR-FloodGate","WAR-Islander","WAR-Islander_Necris","WAR-MarketDistrict","WAR-OnyxCoast","WAR-Powersurge","WAR-Serenity","WAR-Serenity_Necris","WAR-SinkHole","WAR-TankCrossing","WAR-Torlan","WAR-Torlan_Leviathan","WAR-Torlan_Necris"))
GameSpecificMapCycles=(GameClassName="UTDuelGame",Maps=("DM-Arsenal","DM-Biohazard","DM-CarbonFire","DM-Deck","DM-Defiance","DM-Deimos","DM-Diesel","DM-Fearless","DM-Gateway","DM-HeatRay","DM-RisingSun","DM-Sanctuary","DM-Sentinel","DM-ShangriLa"))
```

## **Admin Commands**

You meant to be able to admin the game using rcon but when we tried it although adminlogin worked none of the subsequent commands did.

First off login with: AdminLogin &lt;password&gt;

The you can use the following command:

-   AdminLogin &lt;password&gt; - Logs you in as an admin
-   AdminLogout - Logs you out of admin mode

-   Admin addbots &lt;\#&gt; - Adds number of bots
-   Admin killbots - Removes all bots
-   AdminPlayerList - Shows PlayerID of players
-   Adminkick &lt;playername&gt; - Kicks player from current game
-   Adminkickban &lt;playername&gt; - Kicks player from current game and bans player from reconnecting \(bans are stored in .ini file for later editing\)
-   AdminForceVoiceMute &lt;playername&gt; - Blocks a player from sending voip to others
-   AdminForceVoiceUnMute &lt;playername&gt; - Allows a player to resume sending voip to others
-   AdminForceTextMute &lt;playername&gt; - Blocks a player from sending text to others
-   AdminForceTextUnMute &lt;playername&gt; - Allows a player to resume sending text to others

When your done you can logout with: AdminLogout
