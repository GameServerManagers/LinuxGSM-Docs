# Garrys Mod

Autorefresh can lag the server when certain Lua files are edited. This happens when the refreshing cascades. This can be unwanted behaviour when editing the scripts of a large project on a live server.

To disable autorefresh, add `-disableluarefresh` to parms.

```text
 -disableluarefresh
```
