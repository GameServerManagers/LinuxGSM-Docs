## Mod Support

ARK server mods are managed using the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/workshop/), this allows the auto-install and update of mods.

### Adding Mods

Firstly, you need to select the mods you want to use from the [steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/workshop/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Mods can cause your server to become unstable or may not be compatible with each other. It is a good idea to read the mods docs and/or speak with other experienced ARK admins.
{% endhint %}

Here is a simple mod to get started:

* [Editable Server UI \(WBUI\) Open Source - 924619115](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=924619115)

`-automanagedmods`is the required [parameter](../configuration/start-parameters.md) to add workshop support and is added to the start parameters by default.

Edit `GameUserSettings.ini`, adding the following line under `[ServerSettings]`. To add multiple mods use a comma delimiter e.g `ActiveMods=924619115,924619652`.

```text
[ServerSettings]
ActiveMods=924619115
```

Next, edit or create `Game.ini` and add the following section, this will enable auto-download of mods. To add multiple mods add another `ModIDS=` line underneath the first.

```text
[ModInstaller]
ModIDS=924619115
```

For the example mod add the following to `GameUserSettings.ini` other mods may require there own configuration as per there documentation.

```text
[WBUI]
Icon=1
OpenBtn=0
HideBuff=true
HideAfter=60
TribeTab=true
OpenOnStart=true
OnlyNewPlayers=true
UseJson=false
JsonURL="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6rhwbq95wwm5gkd/UI.json"
UpdateInterval=24
```

For more config options for WBUI see this [link](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/924619115/129069130858283275).

Start the server and the mods will be automatically downloaded by the server. To check that this has worked open the console `./arkserver console`. In the console, you will see a message similar to the following.

{% hint style="info" %}
Large mods may take several minutes to download to the server.
{% endhint %}

```

If you join before the server or your client has fully downloaded the mod you might get a _Mod Version Mismatch_ error. Simply, give the server more time to load the mods.

Once you have connected to the server you will be able to see that the mod has loaded by seeing the _Mod Name_ in the game menu `Esc`.

The example mod can be activated by pressing `F1`.

### Mod Collections

The Steam workshop has a feature that allows mods to be grouped in collections. Currently, Steam workshop collection ids won't work directly with ARK. Instead, you need to have all the individual ids of the mods you want to use.

{% hint style="success" %}
To get individual item ids from collections you can use the [Steam Collection ID Grabber](https://tools.rusty.info/tools/stcolids/).
{% endhint %}

## Clusters

A cluster allows an admin to group ARK servers together, usually servers on different maps. Allowing the transfer characters between the different servers.

### Multi-Instance

ARK will not work with LinuxGSM [multi instances ](../features/multiple-game-servers.md)in the same directory. This is due to its reliance on `GameUserSettings.ini` meaning multiple instances must use the same settings.

### Adding Servers to Clusters

Firstly, setup [multiple ARK game server instances](../features/multiple-game-servers.md).

Change the command-line parameters for your server instances by editing the instance configs:

**arkserver.cfg**

```text
port="7777"
queryport="27015"
rconport="27020"
```

```text
TheIsland?SessionName=LinuxGSM Session 1?AltSaveDirectoryName=${defaultmap}?listen?MultiHome=${ip}?MaxPlayers=${maxplayers}?QueryPort=${queryport}?RCONPort=${rconport}?Port=${port} -automanagedmods -NoTransferFromFiltering -clusterid=cluster1
```

**arkserver-2.cfg**

```text
port="7779"
queryport="27017"
rconport="27022"
```

```text
Ragnarok?SessionName=LinuxGSM Session 2?AltSaveDirectoryName=?ScorchedEarth_P?listen?MultiHome=${ip}?MaxPlayers=${maxplayers}?QueryPort=${queryport}?RCONPort=${rconport}?Port=${port} -automanagedmods -NoTransferFromFiltering -clusterid=cluster1
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Servers which are running on _local networks_ sometimes have trouble travelling to other arks. A potential fix for this is adding `MultiHome=0.0.0.0` to your command-line parameters.
