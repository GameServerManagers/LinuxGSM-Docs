## Server Resources

[FAQ](https://xonotic.org/faq/)

## Ports

- Game Port Default: 26000 UDP

## Default Config Location

### Client Specific

As written in the FAQ, the default Configuration files are located in:

| System | Location |
|--|--|
| Linux | $HOME/.xonotic/data/ |
| Windows | %USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\xonotic\ |
| MacOS | $HOME/Library/Application Support/xonotic/ |

### Serverhosting Locations

You can start Xonotic with the startparameter '-userdir'. With this parameter, Xonotic expects in that folder a subfolder `data` with the `server.cfg`. For example for choosing `./xonotic-linux64-dedicated -userdir /home/xonotic/server1` your server.cfg location should be `/home/xonotic/server1/data/server.cfg`

## Game Modes

## Custom Maps

### Server side

Xonotic has Custom Maps support in fileformat `pk3`. Maps should be located in the data folder like `server.cfg` on your dedicated Server.

### Make it useable for Clients

Xonotic doesn't provide a Filedownloader inside the gameserver, have need to host your custommaps on HTTP Webspace and set the correct values in `server.cfg`.

#### Example

- Userdir: `-userdir /home/xonotic/server1`: add `foo.pk3`in `/home/xonotic/server1/data/`
-  `server.cfg`: Add `sv_curl_defaulturl="http://xonotic.foo.bar"`
- Put `foo.pk3` in the HTTP Root Folder to make it accessable via `http://xonotic.foo.bar/foo.pk3`

Look at [Xonotic Wiki](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/-/wikis/Automatic-map-downloads) for more infos about Custom Map Hosting

## Start parameters

Every Server cvar can be overwritten in an starting argument, but it's recommended to setup as much as possible in `server.cfg`
