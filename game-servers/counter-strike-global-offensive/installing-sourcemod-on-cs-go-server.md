## CS:GO Sourcemod Tips

If the server keeps changing to dust or mirage instead of the chosen map, disable the nextmap plugin.

If players are kicked after joining, make sure Sourcemod does not have any errors and is up to date

Check folder hierarchy in archives before unpacking, each plugin creator organizes their archives differently.
