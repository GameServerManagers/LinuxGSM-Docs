If players are respawning in random locations on custom maps, set `mp_randomspawn` to 0.

If players are being banned for dying too much, such as on minigames maps, as a workaround set `mp_autokick` to 0. **Warning, this disables AFK and Teamkilling kicks as well.**

[Install Sourcemod on CS:GO Server](../guides/sourcemod-csgo-server.md)

## **Setting for a 128 Tick Server**

Add to the following to the config `lgsm/csgoserver/csgoserver.cfg` :

`tickrate="128"`

AS well it is needed to add a few options to the game config \(default in: `serverfiles/csgo/cfg/csgoserver.cfg` \)

```text
sv_mincmdrate 128
sv_minupdaterate 128
```

This will as well force the client to use the 128 tickrate
