# Valheim

Due to the large influx of new LGSM users specifically setting up Valheim servers, here are areas to get started after installing a server.



[LinuxGSM Config Page](../configuration/linuxgsm-config.md)

Shows where to apply settings for a server using LGSM config files.



[LinuxGSM Cronjobs](../configuration/cronjobs.md)

Cronjobs can be used to schedule server updates+restarts.

## Valheim Tips:

Direct connect to Valheim server:

Valheim's in-game browser can be slow, as a workaround you can directly connect to a server in-game through the Join Game tab by pressing the Join IP button, or by adding a server to your steam server favorites. To access the steam server list, at the top left of the steam library window go View-&gt;Servers, and in the new window press "Add A Server". Use `./vhserver details` to list the current query port. The default port is 2457.

Long Server Names:

Valheim has been previously known to have problems with long server names and special characters,  if you are having trouble connecting to a server try making its name shorter or remove special characters.
