# Valheim

Due to the large influx of new LGSM users specifically setting up Valheim servers, here are areas to get started after installing a server.

L[inuxGSM Config Page](../configuration/linuxgsm-config.md)

Shows where to apply settings for a server using LGSM config files.

[LinuxGSM Cronjobs](../configuration/cronjobs.md)

Cronjobs can be used to schedule server updates+restarts.

## Valheim Tips:

Joining a Valheim Server Without Ingame Browser

Valheim's in-game browser only shows 4920 servers at a time, as a workaround direct connect by adding a server to your steam server favorites. The port to use is the query port, which is `2457` by default. `./vhserver details` will list the current query port. To access the steam server list, at the top left of the steam library window go View-&gt;Servers, and in the new window press "Add A Server".
