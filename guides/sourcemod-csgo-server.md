## General Sourcemod Tips

If players are kicked after joining, make sure Sourcemod does not have any errors and is up to date&#x20;

Check folder hierarchy in archives before unpacking, each plugin creator organizes their archives differently.

The server may need to be set to sv_pure 0 in some cases.

[Take note that some servers require a manually generated and placed .vdf file(link).](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_Metamod:Source#GameInfo)

## CS:GO Sourcemod Tips

If the server changes to dust or mirage instead of the chosen map, disable the nextmap plugin.&#x20;
