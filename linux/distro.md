# distro

Picking a distro to run a game server is a personal choice and different admins have different preferences. There is no correct answer to which distro an individual chooses. However, there are some recommended choices when using LinuxGSM.

LinuxGSM developers primarily use Ubuntu for development and attempt to support the ones listed below. While LinuxGSM developers will attempt to support other distros there is no guarantee everything will work as expected, but should an issue occur, submitting GitHub issues is welcome.

## Debian Based Distributions

### Ubuntu

#### **Reasons to use Ubuntu with LinuxGSM:**

1. **Stability and Reliability:** Ubuntu is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. It is renowned for its stability and reliability, making it an excellent choice for hosting game servers. Ubuntu's LTS (Long-Term Support) releases, which are published every two years, offer an extended support lifespan, ensuring that your server remains secure and up-to-date for an extended period.
2. **Game Developer Preference:** Ubuntu has gained popularity among game developers and companies like Valve. This preference is due to Ubuntu's consistent and timely software updates, allowing game developers to work with newer libraries and tools, which is essential for developing and running modern game servers.
3. **Large and Supportive Community:** With a vast user base, Ubuntu boasts an active and helpful community. This large community ensures that you can easily find solutions to issues, access guides, and receive support when setting up or troubleshooting your game server.
4. **User-Friendly Experience:** Ubuntu is known for its user-friendly interface, making it an attractive choice for both experienced Linux users and newcomers. The distribution provides an intuitive environment, simplifying the server setup process for those who might be new to managing game servers.
5. **Preferred Distro for LinuxGSM Development:** Ubuntu is the main choice for the development of LinuxGSM itself. Using Ubuntu ensures that you have the best compatibility and the smoothest experience when running LinuxGSM for managing your game servers.

#### **Recommendations for Ubuntu Usage with LinuxGSM:**

1. **Choose LTS Releases:** It is highly recommended to use Ubuntu LTS releases for hosting game servers. LTS releases offer a longer support lifespan (typically 5 years) compared to standard releases (which have a support period of 6 months). This longer support period means fewer disruptions and security risks for your game server.
2. **Latest LTS Version:** Whenever you install a game server, opt for the latest LTS release available at that time. This ensures that you have access to the latest software and updates, maximizing compatibility and security.
3. **Optional Upgrades:** If your game server is currently running on an older LTS release and is functioning correctly, upgrading to a newer LTS release is optional. However, consider upgrading at an appropriate time to stay current with the latest features and security patches.

#### **Reasons to use Debian with LinuxGSM:**

1. **Rock-Solid Stability:** Debian is renowned for its unmatched stability and reliability. As the upstream distribution for Ubuntu, it serves as the foundation for many popular Linux distributions, including Ubuntu itself. For game servers that require a stable and consistent environment, Debian is an excellent choice.
2. **Long Release Cycle:** Debian follows a predictable release cycle, with major stable releases approximately every two years. This extended cycle ensures a robust and mature platform for hosting game servers, minimizing the need for frequent system updates and reconfigurations.
3. **Backports Support:** One of Debian's significant advantages is the availability of "backports." These are newer versions of software packages that can be installed on stable Debian releases. This feature allows you to access the latest software and libraries that might be required for running specific game servers and LinuxGSM.
4. **Wide Package Selection:** Debian boasts a vast repository of software packages, covering a broad range of applications and tools. This extensive selection ensures that you can easily find and install the necessary dependencies and server components to run your game servers smoothly.
5. **Security Focus:** Security is a top priority for Debian's development team. The distribution is known for its prompt security updates and active maintenance, making it a secure choice for hosting game servers and protecting them from potential threats.

#### **Recommendations for Debian Usage with LinuxGSM:**

1. **Stable Releases:** For most game server deployments, it is recommended to use Debian's stable releases. These versions have undergone extensive testing and are well-suited for production environments.
2. **Backports for Newer Software:** If your game server or LinuxGSM requires newer software versions, consider using the backports repository. This way, you can leverage the latest software while still benefiting from Debian's overall stability.
3. **Security Updates:** Regularly apply security updates to keep your Debian server secure and protected from potential vulnerabilities. Debian's robust security team ensures that security patches are promptly released and widely available.
4. **Consider System Requirements:** Before choosing Debian, ensure that your game server's software and any specific tools you intend to use are compatible with the version of Debian you plan to install. Verify system requirements to ensure optimal performance.

{% hint style="info" %}
CentOS is no longer recommended for use with LinuxGSM for hosting game servers.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Rocky Linux or Alma Linux are now the recommended alternative Enterprise Linux Distro
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
[Significant changes](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/) in the future of CentOS have occurred.
{% endhint %}

#### **Reasons for the Change:**

1. **Shift to CentOS Stream:** CentOS Stream has become the rolling-release development version of RHEL, rather than a downstream clone of RHEL. This change means CentOS Stream might receive more frequent updates, which can introduce unpredictability and potential compatibility issues when managing game servers with LinuxGSM.
2. **Impact on Stability:** CentOS Stream's shift towards being an upstream development platform might lead to reduced stability compared to previous CentOS versions. For hosting game servers, a stable environment is crucial to ensure consistent performance and avoid unnecessary disruptions.
