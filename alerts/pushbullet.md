## Enable Pushbullet alerts

To enable Pushbullet alerts you need to generate an Access Token.

Access Tokens are available from Pushbullet setting found [here](https://www.pushbullet.com/#settings).

Once you have created a token insert it in to your [LinuxGSM config](../configuration/linuxgsm-config.md).

```bash
# Pushbullet Alerts | https://github.com/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/wiki/Pushbullet
pushbulletalert="on"
pushbullettoken="o.noWN6jpIeBUkLraw24saHKd7ksOkn7on"
channeltag=""
```

## Enable Channels

Alerts can also be sent to Pushbullet channels. Channels are push notification feeds that can be subscribed to. Anything you push to a channel will instantly go to all of the channel's subscribers. Only the owner of a channel can push to it.

Visit [here](https://www.pushbullet.com/my-channel) to generate a channel.

Once you have created the channel set the channeltag in the script without using hash `#`.

```text
channeltag="myepicserver"
```

## Send Test Alert

Finally test that everything correctly works by sending a test alert.

```text
./gameserver test-alert
```
