# force-update

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a command for game servers using [SteamCMD](../steamcmd/) only.
{% endhint %}

The `force-update` command bypasses the update check and runs the SteamCMD update regardless of update availability. This will run the SteamCMD update and restart the game server.

Force update is a useful feature for admins that restart their server daily. It allows LinuxGSM to check for updates while restarting the server.

## Commands
