# debug

The `debug` command is used to start your server directly in your current terminal, outside of [tmux](../requirements/tmux.md), and should only be used for diagnosing issues. If a game server is already running in the background debug will stop it to start a `debug` session.

## Commands

Standard: `./gameserver debug`

Short: `./gameserver d`

{% hint style="success" %}
To exit debug mode use `CTRL+c`
{% endhint %}
