# Local/Home Server

## Home Servers

Home servers are a great way to experiment with game servers, for LAN parties or can be used as a permanent option if you have the bandwidth. There are extra steps required on your home router to allow external access to your game server. This will normally involve opening ports on the router firewall and/or port forwarding. See [this link](https://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/) for basic instructions. See your router's manual for specific instructions.

### Specifying you IP for Home Server

If you want to specify the game server IP address using the `ip=` you will need to set the IP address of the servers LAN interface \(e.g 192.168.1.2\), not your routers external IP. Setting this incorrectly will prevent the game server ports from binding and your server will not start.
