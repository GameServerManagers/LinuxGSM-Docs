## For Developers

An exit code is generated when you specify a logfile message _e.g fn_script_log_fatal_. When you want the script to exit you must use core_exit.sh rather than just the exit command. core_exit.sh will then handle the exit. Each time you have a new variable for writing to the log file the code will change to that code. For example if LinuxGSM experiences and error with code 2 then resolves the issue and passes the final code will be 0.

### Examples

```text
fn_script_log_fatal "RCON password is not set"
core_exit.sh
```

This will exit with code 1

```text
fn_script_log_error "RCON password is not set"
core_exit.sh
```

This will exit with code 2

```text
fn_script_log_error "SteamCMD is missing"
LinuxGSM installs SteamCMD
fn_script_log_pass "SteamCMD has been installed"
core_exit.sh
```

This will exit with code 0
