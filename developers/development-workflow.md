# development-workflow

As there are more people developing and adding to LinuxGSM. I though it would be a good idea to highlight the workflow of LinuxGSM to make sure the code can efficiently get in to the master branch and we do not get an a muddle and I can simply review code.

The workflow is pretty much the same as Git Flow. I highly recommend reading this post that tells you all about git flow [http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
