# syntax-and-conventions

In order to make LinuxGSM as coherent as possible, we adopted some code conventions to follow.
Here are some of them.

## Variables

### Naming variables

Variables should be made of lowercase letters only.

### Defining variables

Any variable should be defined through double quotes

```bash
var="value"
```

### Calling variables

Variable should always be called between brackets and double quotes to prevent globbing and word splitting.

```bash
echo "${var}"
```

### Directories

Directories are called using LinuxGSM directories variables, or relative to those.

Examples:

```bash
cp "config.cfg" "${servercfgfullpath}"
find "${executabledir}/bin"
```

## Conditional checks

### Syntax

-   The `if [ statement ]; then` should be a one-liner operation.
-   Signs comparators like ==; &lt;; &lt;=; etc. are prefered to -eq -le -lt.
-   Anything within an if statement must be tabulated one step deeper.

Example:

```bash
if [ "${test}" == "${var}" ]; then
    mycheck="true"
fi
```

### Checks to avoid

#### `! -z`and `! -n`

A `-z` check returns true if a variable is not defined.
A `-n` check returns true if a variable is defined.

For that matter, you should use `-n` rather than `! -z` and use `-z` rather than `! -n`.

## Loops

-   Loops should be a one liner statement.
-   Anything withing a loop must be tabulated one step deeper.

```bash
while [ "${var}" < "${cap}" ]; do
    echo "This is tabulated"
    let var=var+1
done
```

## Functions

-   Function should be named starting with `fn_` and using lowercase letters only.
-   Any recurrent task should be put into a function.
-   Anything within a function must be tabulated one step deeper.

Example:

```bash
fn_myfunction(){
    echo "This is tabulated"
}
```

## Messages

-   Messages should be given using core_messages.sh forms
-   Additional information messages are given in the form of echo " \* Message here"
